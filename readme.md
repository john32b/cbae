## What is it
**CBAE** (**C**ue **B**in **A**udio **E**ncoder) is a CLI tool that can encode the audio tracks of a CD image with the **cue/bin** format into OPUS, FLAC, VORBIS or MP3. The new CD Image can then be used in software that supports loading `.cue` files with encoded audio tracks (mostly emulators like DosBox).

**It does a few things more than just convert audio files from one format to another**
- It can work with single `.bin` files that contain the entire CD
- It generates a new `.cue` file with correct properties
- It does it fast as the encoding tasks run in parallel

### Example
![CBAE running](media/s1.png)

Take the original release of **"Quake (1996)"**, a single CD Image, including ten (**10**) CD-DA Tracks. Here is a size comparison between the raw image and encoded audio .cue/.bin images.

| Audio       | Audio Tracks | Data Tracks | Total Size |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| CD-DA       | 595MB        | 28MB        | **623MB**  |
| FLAC        | 255MB        | 28MB        | **283MB**  |
| OPUS 64Kbps | 26MB         | 28MB        | **55MB**   |

The OPUS codec produces very nice audio quality even at low bitrates. The encoded Quake CD got a reduction down to **9%** of the original raw CD size.

## Getting and Running
CBAE is a nodejs script. It is a single file and has no external dependencies other than FFmpeg. You can download the script from here or from npm.

- From NPM.
```bash
# Download and install globally
npm i cbae --location=global
# Run
cbae
```
- Or download the script manually from github
```bash
# Clone the git to a dir of your choice
git clone https://github.com/john32b/cbae --depth 1
# Run
cd cbae/bin
node cbae
```
- Or for Windows, download the Executable that does not require NodeJS
	- You can find this in the [Releases Tab in Github](https://github.com/john32b/cbae/releases)

**In Short, you need:**
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org), version 16+
- [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/), set on your PATH *(So it can run from anywhere by calling ffmpeg)* 
- Some basic command line knowledge is a plus

**TIP**: For Windows the easiest way to get FFmpeg on path, is to copy `ffmpeg.exe` in your Windows dir (usually `C:\Windows`)

### Running
**Quick Examples**
```bash
# Encode all .cue cd images from H:\DOS\cdimages into b:\encoded\
# and convert audio tracks to FLAC
cbae H:/DOS/cdimages/*.cue -o b:/encoded -enc FLAC

# Encode TombRaider2.cue into the current working directory
# convert audio to Vorbis 128KBPS, using 12 parallel tasks
cbae TombRaider2.cue -o . -enc VORBIS:128 -p 12

# Print information for all cue files in current dir
cbae i *.cue
```

**For HELP and USAGE** call `cbae -help`  

**INPUT**. A valid .cue file, full path or relative path. Supports multiple inputs. 
- In Linux you can do file globbing,  `/home/janko/iso/**/*.cue`
- In Windows basic file globbing is supported,  `c:\games\cd\*.cue`
- For multiple inputs separate with space,  `game1.cue game2.cue ...`
	
**OUTPUT**. A directory where the new folders will be created. Full or relative path. 
- Set with `-o` . e.g. `cbae quake.cue -o /tmp/ ...` -- Will create `/tmp/quake [e]/`
- Newly created folders come with the postfix `[e]`, for `Encoded` 
- If you give `=src` then the output folder will be created on the base directory of the input .cue file.

**ACTION** `e` Encode, *(default)*
The main thing, takes .cue files and encodes the audio tracks to a codec of your choice<sup>\*</sup> (*more later*). Generates a new .cue file and puts all the new files in a new folder under the declared *output*
- This is the *default action* meaning, you can skip declaring it. e.g. `cbae e input.cue ...` is the same as `cbae input.cue ...`
- Example : `cbae ~/iso/TR3.cue -o =src -enc VORBIS:96` --> Will encode `TR3.cue` using Vorbis 96kbps and will put everything in `~/iso/TR3 [e]`

**ACTION** `i` Info. With this you can view some information on a .cue/.bin cd image

**OPTION** `-p` sets the maximum number of concurrent encodes that can run. It gets a default value of 3/4 the threads of your system.

**OPTION**  `-enc` sets encoder and bitrate, given in a single parameter in the format `codec:kbps` 
- e.g. `cbae .... -enc OPUS:80` -> will use OPUS codec at 80KBPS
- e.g. `cbae .... -enc FLAC` -> will use FLAC. Notice that it doesn't require the `:KBPS` part


**Here is a list of codecs supported, along with the valid range of kbps.**

| Codec ID         | Min Kbps | Max Kbps |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- |
| MP3              | 32       | 320      |
| MP3V<sup>*</sup> | 44       | 256      |
| OPUS             | 28       | 500      |
| VORBIS           | 64       | 500      |
| FLAC             | -        | -        |

<sup>*: MP3 is constant bitrate, while MP3V is variable bitrate.</sup> 

> **Notes**: 
> - If a CD Image does not include any audio tracks then it will be skipped.
> - On multiple file input, if a file fails, cbae will continue to the next file in queue.
> - Press `CTRL+C` to exit the program at any time.
> - TIP: Do not use MP3 if other codecs are supported in your software. They are there to satisfy some edge cases, like that old KEGA Fusion emulator that only supports MP3 CD images.

## Um, what does CBAE do exactly?
CBAE takes a `.cue/.bin` file combo, copies the data tracks as they are, and uses FFmpeg to encode the audio tracks into separate files. Finally it produces a new `.cue` file and puts everything into a new folder.

![Visual Example](media/s2.png)
<sup>a picture is worth a thousand words</sup>

A new `.cue` file is generated and it makes the tracks point to the new encoded audio files.

```text
FILE "QUAKE 1 (1996) - Track 01.bin" BINARY
	TRACK 01 MODE1/2352
	INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE "QUAKE 1 (1996) - Track 02.opus" OPUS
	TRACK 02 AUDIO
	INDEX 01 00:00:00
	...
	...
FILE "QUAKE 1 (1996) - Track 11.opus" OPUS
	TRACK 11 AUDIO
	INDEX 01 00:00:00
```


## Software/Emulators that support .cue files with encoded audio files
- **DosBox** staging supports {Flac, Opus, Vorbis, Mp3, Wav} -- https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging#feature-differences
- **Mednafen** supports : {Vorbis, Flac, Wav} -- https://mednafen.github.io/documentation/
- I'm sure there are more, *(help me expand this list?)*

## MORE

### What about CHD ?
CHD is an entirely different thing and from what I understand CHD can only include lossless audio plus not all programs/emulators support it.

### Wait, what about CDCRUSH ?
This older project of mine [CDCRUSH](https://github.com/john32b/cdcrush) has the functionality to encode audio tracks of a CD. But cdcrush is kinda dead now. It tried to do many things at once, and its main feature to highly compress a cd image into cold storage is *(I think)* deprecated by other archivers that allow the archives to be mounted. Perhaps not in the same compression ratios as cdcrush offered, but nonetheless ready to be accessed. Things like **squashFS** and **dwarFS** among others, they provide very good compression ratios, so for me, it makes sense to keep CD images in a compressed format that are ready to be mounted and played.

Then why not update the cdcrush code? I don't like the code, some parts are messy and others bloated, so I thought it would be better to do fresh start using pure JS *(cdcrush was written in Haxe)* while only implementing the useful stuff, which is audio encode a CD. In other words cdcrush is deprecated.
